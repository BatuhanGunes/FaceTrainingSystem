# Face Training System

This project takes live images via a computer camera. Face recognition is performed in this live image. It shows the face to the user with the help of a frame. The user trains the system by writing to whom this face belongs. In order to train the system, photo pieces taken from the live image are saved in the project files. In the next facial detections, it is estimated who owns the face by comparing the detected faces with the registered faces.
